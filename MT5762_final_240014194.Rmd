## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readdata}
bike <- read.csv("Bike_sharing_2022.csv")
```


Part 1: Exploratory Analysis [5 marks]



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(bike)

class(bike$count)
unique(bike$season)


class(bike$holiday)
hist(bike$holiday)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Part 2 [10 marks]

 Days with fewer than 35,000 rented bikes are not profitable for TfL. Therefore, the managing
 director of TfL asks you to estimate:
 
 a) the expected proportion of days with fewer than 35,000 rented bikes;
 
 b) a 90% confidence interval for that proportion;
 
 c) the expected proportion of days with fewer than 35,000 rented bikes for each season;
 
 d) whether there is a difference between the proportions in winter and spring.


 Make sure to include interpretations of your analyses above that are useful for the target
 audience.
